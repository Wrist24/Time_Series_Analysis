# Time_Series_Analysis
Project 1: Simulating a time series based on an ARMA (Autoregressive, moving-average) model;
Decomposing a time series dividing it into trend, seasonality and residual components in order to allow for forecasting of the time series x periods into the future.
Project 2: Time series imputation using various methods;
Selecting appropriate proxy variables (variables with correlation to the data in the time series) to use for disaggregating the time series, i.e. 
creating a time series with a higher frequency from one with a lower frequency, with or without proxy variables;
Choosing a panel data model using the time series to detect potential hidden variables with impact on the time series.
